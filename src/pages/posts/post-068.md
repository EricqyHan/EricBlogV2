Went to the Livingston Mall today. Everything there looks so depressing. Nothing is left there anymore. I remember going as a kid and having fun there. I even remember going there on Halloween to get candy. Burger King even left there. I went to get Auntie Anne's and the quality was terrible. I should get start making my own.
