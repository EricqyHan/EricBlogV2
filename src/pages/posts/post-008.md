It's Sunday. We all know what that means. I wake up at a "normal" time and looks like I will be pulling another all nighter. Fell asleep around 0400 this morning and woke up around 1000. I did however get a nice nap in around 1330 this afternoon. Just startd coding for the night. I wish I started earlier. I was able to get all you can eat sushi with some friends. Feeling super bloated right now and spent around 75 minutes on the treadmill trying to burn it off.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to continue learning to make my site better.
2. **What I learned** Nothing today. Need to ramp up my coding or 2023 won't be much better for my career.
3. **Exercise** 75 minutes on the treadmill. About 538 calories.
