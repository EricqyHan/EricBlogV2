Didn't sleep well over the weekend. It was actually mostly Saturday. Didn't sleep from 5:00 PM Friday to Saturday night around 8:30 PM. I was only able to sleep until 2:30 AM. Then passed out again from 2 PM Sunday to 9 PM and worked my overnight shift until 7:30 AM. I was exhausted today and slept from 8:30 AM to 5 PM and then took another nap and went to MMA. I remembered a time where I could do this and not sleep for this long. Can't wait to not work overnights anymore and have a normal sleep schedule.
