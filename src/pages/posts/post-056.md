It's finally May. I have 23 shifts left at Tiffany. I still have not found a new job yet. It's been tough and I feel burned out. It's also going to be a tough week. I have Stan's wedding on Saturday and my sleep schedule is very messed up right now. It's time to take on the rest of the May and get back into coding.
