Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro and getting back into programming! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new apps.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Finished Setting Up Astro Blog**: I setup my astro blog today.

2. **What I learned**: I would have had this blog ready yesterday, but I encountered an error with getting Astro setup. I had issues finding a lot of help in forums. I was getting a failure code 1 after selecting the type of project I wanted. This issue held me up for about 45 minutes of searching until I downgraded to Node 16 instead of 18. I was able to get it working after that.

3. **Exercise** I _ran_ 3.5 miles today. Was a slow and terrible run, but I made it outside.

## What's next

Whatâ€™s is in store for 2023? I plan on getting back into my coding journey. Build a few full stack applications I had planned for 2022, get back in shape and run a half-marathon in under 2 hours, and eat better.
