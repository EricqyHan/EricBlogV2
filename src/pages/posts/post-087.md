My Dark Elf Dumbbells came in yesterday. Shipping was pretty fast. I ordered them Wednesday night and they arrived on Monday afternoon. They are pretty cool. I was told not to practice punching them becasue they are "too heavy" for that type of workout. My coach said three to five pounds is best for that kind of boxing workout. I can't wait to really use them.
