Friday the 13th. Not much happened today. I finally saw John Wick 2 and 3. I did this while on the Treadmill. Only got 2 hours of sleep after work because I was too excited it was Friday. Is my blog posting? I realized some of the articles might not be popping up. I will have to get that fixed.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to implement a better template.
2. **What I learned** Lets see if I can finsih class 8 review before the night ends.
3. **Exercise** Got over 13,000 steps today!
