Ran three miles today and did some cleaning around the house. Got some Hangry Joe's for dinner. 

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to continue and finish the layout.
2. **What I learned** Nothing today. I was spending time time with family.
3. **Exercise** Run three miles today. I will run four tomorrow.
