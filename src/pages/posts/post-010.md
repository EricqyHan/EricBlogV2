I think I might have shin splints. The past few days my shins have really hurt and I can't run more than 100 meters without it hurting. I need to cut back on the running so it can heal. This is America and I can't afford to go to the hospital.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to create a better theme.
2. **What I learned** Working on reviewing class 7 for 100Devs on CommunityTaught.org.
3. **Exercise** Did some squatting today and pull ups since I can't run right now.
