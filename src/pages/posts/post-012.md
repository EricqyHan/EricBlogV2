It's almost the weekend. I plan on rebuilding this site from the ground up. I need to implement a better template. I was thinking about using Blogster Newspaper. It will be just like how Flavio Copes has his site. I want this site to really show my development and year in 2023. I also finally added the a link in my portfolio to this astro blog.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to implement a better template.
2. **What I learned** Working on reviewing class 8 for 100Devs on CommunityTaught.org.
3. **Exercise** I woke up feeling super lethargic. It was raining and I did not have the energy to exercise. Only plus today was having one meal. These overnighs really mess up my sleep and eating schedule.
