I need to start talking more about other material on this blog instead of me. I should model it after Flavio Copes' site and put better materal out to help other developers. I know I can talk about Excel, Power BI, and coding. This information would be more helpful to people instead of just talking about mylife. These tags will help out too. I also started 100Devs back up again. 100Devs is a community to learn to code and get a job. They have an amazing site made by a member [CommunityTaught](https://communitytaught.org/). I want to have my full stack site done by mid April.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to continue learning to make my site better.
2. **What I learned** Nothing today. Need to ramp up my coding or 2023 won't be much better for my career.
3. **Exercise** Ran about 2.5 miles today. Monday is always a struggle.
