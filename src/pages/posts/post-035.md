Took a few days off from updating the blog. Been feeling really sick from the weather. Was hoping to revamp the blog this weekend and finish it off. Unfortunately I was feeling really sick on Friday. It's Sunday night again and works week starts in less than 30 minutes. Need to put this on my Kanban board and finally finish this blog.
