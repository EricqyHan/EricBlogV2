My Deskhaus Detroit Standing desk came in today. I didn't get much coding code today because I wanted to have this desk ready for my last shift of the week. Really give it a test drive and asee how a standing desk is.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Astro Blog** I need to get images working. They are linked but not showing.
2. **What I learned** Nothing today. Sad face. I was too busy setting up my new desk.
3. **Exercise** Run was only about 2 miles. Tomorrow will be better.
